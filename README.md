This is a repository for distributing files related to projects in Marineholmen Makerspace in Bergen

In order to make the examples work with an [Adafruit Huzza ESP 32](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405) 
and [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) you need to download and install the drivers for the USB to serial chip on
the the Huzzah board - [Silab USB DRIVERS](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers)
